### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the project folder**
   ```bash
   cd pizavibe
   ```

2. **Install all the dependencies**
   ```bash

## Testing

We take testing seriously here. After all, nobody wants a broken pizza ordering system! We've written comprehensive tests to make sure everything works exactly as it should.

### Running Tests

**Run all tests:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Watch mode (for development):**
```bash
npm run test:watch
```
This is super handy when you're actively developing - tests automatically re-run whenever you save a file.

**See test coverage:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
This shows you exactly which parts of your code are covered by tests and which might need more attention.

### What We're Testing

Our test suite is pretty comprehensive. Here's what we cover:

**AddPizzaForm (32 tests)**
- Making sure the form renders correctly with all fields
- Testing that validation works (empty fields, invalid prices, etc.)
- Verifying custom radio buttons work properly
- Testing the ingredient add/remove functionality
- Checking image upload with file validation
- Ensuring form submission and reset work correctly

**CartPage & OrderSummary**
- Empty cart displays correctly
- Items show up properly when added
- Quantity adjustments work as expected
- Price calculations are accurate (including discounts!)
- Order confirmation flow works smoothly with loading states
- Professional loading overlay during order confirmation
- Removing items and clearing cart function properly
- Loading persists until page navigation completes

**PizzaCard & PizzaDetails**
- Pizza information displays correctly
- Add to cart functionality works
- Category indicators show properly
- Navigation links work as expected
- Quantity selection works for custom amounts

We're constantly adding more tests as we add features, so the coverage keeps growing!

The whole process is designed to be intuitive and fast. No unnecessary steps, no confusion - just a delightful pizza ordering experience from start to finish!
